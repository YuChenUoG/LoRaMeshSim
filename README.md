# LoRaMeshSim
## 1. Introduction
* LoRaMeshSim is a discrete-event simulator based on [LoRaSim](https://mcbor.github.io/lorasim/) and [SimPy](https://simpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), designed for simulating collisions and routing in LoRa mesh networks. It facilitates the development of new routing algorithms and the analysis of network reliability, scalability, and coverage.
* The design team belongs to the [Communication, Sensing & Imaging (CSI) group](https://www.gla.ac.uk/research/az/csi/) of the University of Glasgow.
